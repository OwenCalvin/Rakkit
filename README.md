  A simple backend framework written in <b>TypeScript</b> that provide <b> REST API</b> and <b>Websocket</b> tools to build amazing server-side application
</p>

  
### Getting started  

```
npm i rakkit
```
```
yarn add rakkit
```

### The project history  

Initially this tool was to be used to create a homemade Headless CMS. But as the project progressed, our needs grew and our backend application looked more and more like a Framework, so we chose to make it an independent tool to benefit the community and progress on a better basis.


### Philosophy  

We wanted to create a tool that would allow us to create backend applications much more simply with a small learning curve, so that anyone, with some TypeScript basics, could use it. We also didn't want to make a clone of NestJS.


### Features (Full typed, class based with decorated)  

- Rest API Creation ([koa](https://koajs.com/) base)
- Websocket support ([socket.io](https://socket.io/))
